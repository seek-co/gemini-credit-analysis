Construct profitability metric table, liquidity and leverage metric table.
Use API calling data, RAG knowledge vector database and web search results to calculate the metrics below and create the following MARKDOWN table. These metrics can be found in the tables of income statement, cashflow and balance sheet for a company in specific years, so it is very helpful if you include these query keywords when searching in RAG knowledge vector database. Check the API calling financial metric data against the financial metric acquired from the RAG knowledge vector database to make sure that the financial metric values are CORRECT. If the API calling data for a particular entry is 'None' or empty, then acquire the metric information by searching through the RAG knowledge vector database or perform web search for the company's financial metrics. If a particular financial metric value cannot be found in both API calling data and the RAG knowledge vector database, then you do web search to get the missing formula elements to calculate the unfound financial metric value. The financial metrics needed and their respective meaning or formula is:
- Revenue: Revenue of the company, a direct measure of the money generated through product or service sales. Put Revenue entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Round Revenue entries to 2 decimal points.
- EBITDA: Stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization and is a metric used to evaluate a company’s operating performance. Put EBITDA entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Round EBITDA entries to 2 decimal points.
- EBITDA Margin: EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total revenue, and then multiply by 100%. Formula: ((ebitda)/(total revenue))*100%. Round EBITDA Margin entries to 2 decimal points.
- Net Income: Net income is the measure of profit after all expenses are accounted for, including taxes. Put Net Income entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Round Net Income entries to 2 decimal points.
- Net Income Margin: Net Income Margin is calculated by dividing net income by total revenue, and then multiply by 100%. Formula: ((net income)/(total revenue))*100%. Round Net Income Margin entries to 2 decimal points. 
- Cash & Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits, as well as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Put Cash & Equivalents entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Put Cash & Equivalents entries in 2 decimal points.
- Current Ratio: To calculate the current ratio, divide the company’s current assets by its current liabilities. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within one year, while current liabilities are obligations expected to be paid within one year. Put current ratio in the format of: [current ratio value rounded to 2 decimal points]x
- Gross Debt: Gross debt (or Total Debt) is a company's total debt obligations (both short-term and long-term). Formula: (long term debt) + (short term debt). Put Gross Debt entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Round Gross Debt entries to 2 decimal points.
- Net Debt: Net debt is a company's total debt obligations (both short-term and long-term) minus its cash and cash-equivalent assets. Formula: (long term debt) + (short term debt) - (cash and equivalents). Put Net Debt entries in the format of: [local currency] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display, or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display, and showing 2 decimal points] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Round Net Debt entries to 2 decimal points.
- Debt/EBITDA (Leverage ratio): To calculate Debt-to-EBITDA ratio (Leverage ratio), divide the company’s gross debt (or total debt) by EBITDA. Put Debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the format of: [Debt-to-EBITDA ratio value rounded to 2 decimal points]x
- Net Debt/EBITDA (Net leverage ratio): To calculate Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio (Net Leverage ratio), divide the company’s net debt by EBITDA. Put Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the format of: [Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio value rounded to 2 decimal points]x
- Interest Coverage Ratio: Also known as times interest earned (TIE) ratio. It checks for the company's ability to meet interest obligations. Formula: (EBIT)/(Interest Expense). Put interest coverage ratio in the format of: [Interest Coverage Ratio value rounded to 2 decimal points]x

The columns of the metric tables are as follows:
- Latest half-year: H1 or H2 of the most recent year in the provided data.
- Same half-year one-year ago: For example, if latest half-year is 'H1 2022', then 'Same half-year one-year ago' is 'H1 2021'.
- Second-latest half-year: For example, if latest half-year is H1 2022, then 'Second-latest half-year' is 'H2 2021'.
- Year-on-Year Change (YoY Change): Year on year change, calculated by "Latest half-year" column minus "Same half-year one-year ago" column. If the "Latest half-year" column and "Same half-year one-year ago" column entries are non-percentage amount values, then calculate the difference and then take the percentage. Formula: (("Latest half-year" column entry) - ("Same half-year one-year ago" column)) / ("Same half-year one-year ago" column entry) * 100%, and put YoY Change entries in the format of: [positive or negative change whole number value]%. If the "Latest half-year" column and "Same half-year one-year ago" column entries are percentage values, then calculate the difference in the unit measurement of basis points (bps), and put YoY Change entries in the format of: [positive or negative change whole number value] bps. Round YoY Change entries to nearest whole number percentage. 

You must identify the exact latest half-year from the RAG knowledge vector database or by web search. For example, if the latest half-year you identified is H1 2022, then the associated fiscal date ending would be 2021-12-31, and the same half-year one-year ago would be H1 2021 with associated fiscal date ending as 2020-12-31, and the second-latest half-year would be H2 2021 with associated fiscal date ending as 2021-06-30. The fiscal date ending MUST be inthe format of yyyy-mm-dd, where yyyy is the year representation in 4 digits, mm is the month representation in 2 digits and is always either '06' for H2 or '12' for H1, dd is the day representation in 2 digits and dd is always the last day of the month identified. It is VERY IMPORTANT that these half-year values and fiscal date ending values are only EXAMPLES, and you MUST search knowledge database or the web yourself to identify the TRUE half-year values and fiscal date ending values.

Table entries value style and formatting:
- All citation for table entries inside a table must be in the format of square-bracket caret numbering in the format: [^<numbering of your citation>]. Then list right after the table for the citations that are used inside the table, in the format [^<numbering of your citation>]: [follow the same style and format provided to you in the system prompt]. 
- All amount value entries must be in the format of: [local currency short form, example: GBP for british bound] [value rounded to either million or billion for human-readable and pretty display, and standardize this rounding across all rows] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion or 'Mn' if rounded to million]. You must STANDARDIZE the unit million or billion showing across ALL the rows. Decide of the number of decimal points that needs to be shown after rounding to either million or billion, and STANDARDIZE the number of decimal points showing for ALL the rows.
- All final entries displayed in the metric tables must be shown in 2 decimal points.
- All percentage values must be in the format of: [pecentage value rounded to 2 decimal points]%, except for the YoY Change column with whole number percentage.

You must output in MARKDOWN format and must follow this template.
