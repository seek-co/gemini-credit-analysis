Step 1: Use API calling data, RAG knowledge vector database and web search results to construct the bond and debt information table in the 'Debt Structure & Maturity Profile' section. Check the API calling bonds data against the bond information acquired from the RAG knowledge vector database to make sure that the bonds information and values are CORRECT. First get the list of USD and Euro bonds from the API calling data, then for each bond in the list, retrieve further information such as Yield, Z-Spread, Agency's Ratings from the RAG knowledge vector database. It is VERY IMPROTANT that you retrieve information from the tables and figures in the RAG knowledge database. If the API calling data for a particular entry is 'None' or empty, then acquire the bond metric or value information by searching through the RAG knowledge vector database and peform web search for the company's bond information. If a particular bond and debt table value cannot be found in both API calling data and the RAG knowledge vector database, then you do web search to get the missing formula elements to calculate or fill in the unfound bond and debt value. 
Construct the table showing 'Bond Series', where each row is a listing of different bond series in the G3 currencies, where the G3 currencies are USD (US Dollar), GBP (British Pound) and Euro. This table must only show bonds that are maturing in the future after today's date. The bond and debt data needed and their respective meaning and format is:
- Bond Series: Identifiable naming of a bond series, in the format of [coupon rate]% [year of maturity]
- Currency: The currency of the particular bond series.
- Amount ([short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]): The amount issued for the bond. Put the amount in the format of: [Currency short form, example: GBP for british bound] [value rounded to nearest million for pretty display or billion if the number value is still too large after rounding to million display. Example: value '650000000' will round to '650 million'. If the rounded value shows decimal point, then standardize the number of decimal points showing for all the rows] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion, 'Mn' if rounded to million]. Decide of the number of decimal points that needs to be shown after rounding to either million or billion, and STANDARDIZE the number of decimal points showing for ALL the bond series rows.
- Coupon: The coupon rate of the particular bond, in the format of [rate in 2 decimal points]%
- Maturity: The maturity date of the particular bond, in the format of [month, in 3 letter representation with first letter capitalised. eg. Jan for January]-[year, showing last two digits of the year only. for example: 24 for year 2024].
- Yield (Z-Spread): The yield to maturity of the particular bond, and the Z-spread of the bond. When retieving for the yield and Z-Spread information from the RAG knowledge database, or from web search, or from the API calling data, you MUST also consider relevant shorthand notation for Yield and Z-Spread, for example, Yield to Call in short is 'YTC', Yield to Maturity is 'YTM', Z-Spread also in short as OAS, ZSPRD, etc. Put the Yield (Z-Spread) entries in the format of: [yield rounded to 2 decimal points in the unit of percentage]% ([z-spread in the unit of basis points] bps)
- [Agency's] Rating: You must decide based on the retrieved information from RAG knowledge vector database all the available agencies that provided a rating for ALL of the bonds listed as rows in this Bond Series table. Example of rating agencies are JPMargan, S&P, all all others you can identify. Example of agencies rating entries are: Aa2, B-, CCC, and so on, depending on the agency which the rating is from. Format the agencies and ratings from different agencies by using a slash '/', example: [agency #1's rating]/[agency #2's rating], and example for agencies: [agency #1]/[agency #2]

Table entries value style and formatting:
- All citation for table entries inside a table must be in the format of square-bracket caret numbering in the format: [^<numbering of your citation>]. Then list right after the table for the citations that are used inside the table, in the format [^<numbering of your citation>]: [follow the same style and format provided to you in the system prompt]. 
- All amount value entries must be in the format of: [Currency short form, example: GBP for british bound] [value rounded to either million or billion for human-readable and pretty display, and standardize this rounding across all rows] [short form 'Bn' if rounded to billion or 'Mn' if rounded to million]. You must STANDARDIZE the unit million or billion showing across ALL the rows. Decide of the number of decimal points that needs to be shown after rounding to either million or billion, and STANDARDIZE the number of decimal points showing for ALL the rows.
- All percentage values must be in the format of: [pecentage value rounded to 2 decimal points]%.

You must output in MARKDOWN format and must follow this template, WITHOUT any other extra comments.
