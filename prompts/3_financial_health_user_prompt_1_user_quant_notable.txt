Step 1: Construct profitability metric, liquidity and leverage metric, or other quantitative metric tables
Use the provided documents to calculate the metrics listed below and create the required MARKDOWN table using the acquired document data and calculations.
- Revenue
- Adjusted EBITDA
- EBITDA Margin
- Net Income
- Net Income Margin
- Cash & Equivalents
- Current Ratio
- Net Debt (Excl. Leases)
- Debt/EBITDA (LTM)
- Interest Coverage Ratio

The columns of the metric tables are as follows:
- Latest half-year: H1 or H2 of the most recent year in the provided data.
- Same half-year one-year ago: For example, if latest half-year is 'H1 2022', then 'Same half-year one-year ago' is 'H1 2021'.
- Second-latest half-year: For example, if latest half-year is H1 2022, then 'Second-latest half-year' is 'H2 2021'.

For the user provided quantitative metrics:
- Metric #1: Proprietary Ratio
Calculation Formula: Total Equity/ Total Tangible Assets

You must output in MARKDOWN format and must follow this template, WITHOUT any other extra comments.
