    "title": "Cenomi Centers Explores Funding Options as Flagship Malls Drive Growth",
    "body": "RIYADH – Saudi mall developer Cenomi Centers is exploring new financing avenues to support a wave of expansion as two massive 'Jawharat' malls near completion. 'We are looking at all options to fund the massive growth that's coming,' Cenomi Centers Chief Operating Officer Bruno Wehbe said in an interview at a Riyadh retail forum. 'Our CFO is considering a multitude of sources – these include raising financing again, it could be sukuk (Islamic bonds), it could be something else,' Wehbe noted. The company is also weighing the sale of non-core assets like unused land to help finance development, a move already underway as part of its strategy.\nCenomi Centers is in the midst of building two flagship complexes, Jawharat Jeddah and Jawharat Riyadh, which together carry a price tag of over SR5 billion (excluding land costs). Jawharat Jeddah is slated to open in late 2025 and Jawharat Riyadh by early 2026. These lifestyle mega-malls are expected to rank among the top retail destinations in the Middle East. 'Together, excluding land, they will cost upward of SR5 billion… They are expected to rank among the top one to three in their cities and top five in MENA,' Wehbe said of the projects. With roughly 500,000 square meters of space each, the developments will also include offices, entertainment venues, and hotels in later phases.\nTo finance this growth, Cenomi raised a $500 million sukuk last year, part of which went to stabilize its capital structure and improve its credit rating. 'The sukuk we raised last year had multiple purposes: it strengthened the balance sheet and went towards improving the credit rating. We had a BB- rating with a stable outlook,' Wehbe noted. Management's goal is to upgrade that rating as the new malls begin contributing cash flow. 'Ultimately, our goal is to improve our rating… as soon as growth takes shape – through these two Jawharats and other upcoming announcements – we'll see progress,' Wehbe added.\nThe company projects significant returns once the malls are operational. Jawharat Riyadh and Jawharat Jeddah are forecast to contribute more than 50% of Cenomi's current EBITDA upon reaching steady state. That could substantially boost cash flows from 2026 onward. In the meantime, Cenomi's internal cash generation and existing credit lines provide some funding cushion. The COO emphasized that internal operations will help fund capital expenditures, alongside any external financing. Analysts say Cenomi Centers appears proactive in managing its growth financing. 'They're front-loading funding plans, which is prudent,' said a Dubai-based credit strategist. 'The key is that new debt remains moderate relative to the EBITDA these projects will eventually bring.'",
    "impact": "Bullish",
    "reason": "Cenomi's push to secure funding for its new malls is viewed positively given the anticipated surge in cash flow once these projects open. While debt may rise in the short term, the company's strategic asset sales and strong expected EBITDA growth suggest an overall improvement in leverage and credit metrics over the medium term."

    "title": "Cenomi Centers Posts SAR 1.2 Bln Profit as Occupancy Hits Record High",
    "body": "RIYADH – Cenomi Centers reported an annual net profit of SAR 1.22 billion for 2024, an 18% drop from SAR 1.50 billion a year earlier, as higher costs offset modest revenue growth. The Saudi mall operator's revenue inched up 4.0% year-on-year to SAR 2.34 billion, buoyed by new retail tenants and strong foot traffic, according to financial results released today. However, earnings were weighed down by increased operating and financing expenses, causing net margins to shrink. Earnings per share fell to SAR 2.56 from SAR 3.19 the prior year.\nDespite the profit decline, Cenomi Centers highlighted operational strengths. '2024 has been a record-breaking year for us. We reached a new milestone with an occupancy rate of 94.4%, the highest in the company's history, while footfall surged to 131.9 million visitors,' said CEO Alison Rehill-Erguven. The robust occupancy – up from the low 90s a year ago – suggests sustained demand for retail space in Cenomi's portfolio of 22 malls. Executives also noted that tenant sales have been recovering as consumer sentiment in Saudi Arabia remains resilient, contributing to a 5% increase in lease renewal rates.\nRehill-Erguven provided an update on the company's flagship developments. 'Our flagship projects, Jawharat Jeddah and Jawharat Riyadh, are progressing as planned with both construction and leasing efforts on track to be delivered in December 2025 and April 2026, respectively,' the CEO added. These two mega-malls are expected to fuel future growth (and are the subject of significant financing efforts by the company). In the meantime, Cenomi Centers is rewarding shareholders: the board declared a SAR 178.1 million cash dividend for Q3 2024 (SAR 0.37 per share), which will be paid out this month. This marks the third interim dividend of the year, reflecting management's confidence in the firm's cash generation, even as it undertakes heavy capital expenditures.\nOn the balance sheet front, Cenomi Centers' leverage remained manageable in 2024. The company's net debt level was not explicitly disclosed in today's summary, but it recently secured shareholder approval to issue fresh sukuk if needed for its expansion plans. S&P Global Ratings currently assigns Cenomi a 'BB-' credit rating with a stable outlook, and the company has indicated it aims for an upgrade over time by boosting EBITDA and keeping debt in check. For now, Cenomi's existing cash flows comfortably cover its interest obligations, and the slight dip in profit is not alarming to creditors. 'The results show a small decline in earnings, but the dividend and high occupancy signal that underlying operations are strong,' said a Riyadh-based analyst. 'As long as their new projects come online successfully, the outlook for cash flow is positive.'",
    "impact": "Neutral",
    "reason": "The mixed results (higher revenues but lower profits) have no major effect on Cenomi's credit profile. While reduced profit slightly trims internal cash flow, record occupancy and steady expansion plans indicate the core business remains healthy. The company's leverage and liquidity are largely unchanged, keeping credit risk stable."

    "title": "Cenomi Centers Launches High-Speed Connectivity Initiative Across Malls",
    "body": "RIYADH – Cenomi Centers is rolling out a high-tech upgrade across its shopping mall portfolio, partnering with telecom infrastructure provider Tawal to equip all its properties with cutting-edge indoor mobile coverage and Wi-Fi. The mall operator announced during the LEAP 2025 tech conference in Riyadh that it will implement high-speed, seamless connectivity across its 22 retail centers, encompassing over 4,500 stores in 10 Saudi cities. The network enhancement will allow shoppers and tenants to enjoy robust cellular signals and free Wi-Fi inside the malls, supporting everything from quick smartphone transactions to data-heavy streaming and digital experiences.\nThe initiative aims to make Cenomi's malls digitally enabled lifestyle destinations. The new infrastructure will cover all major mobile service providers to ensure no visitor experiences a drop in coverage. It is also future-proofed for emerging technologies like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), meaning it can handle next-generation applications such as augmented reality shopping and smart facility management. 'This infrastructure will be future-ready, supporting 5G, IoT and smart solutions,' the company said, positioning the move as part of its vision for 'digital malls' that blend online and offline retailing.\nAlison Rehill-Erguven, CEO of Cenomi Centers, highlighted the customer experience benefits. 'At Cenomi Centers, we are thrilled to partner with Tawal to offer the best connectivity to our customers. We know that the future of retail is in omnichannel experiences, and we want to ensure that both our customers and our tenants are able to engage with each other across as many mediums as possible,' she said. By enabling shoppers to stay connected, Cenomi expects to drive footfall and increase the time visitors spend in malls, as patrons can seamlessly use social media, navigation apps, and online shopping platforms while on-site. Retailers in the malls will also benefit; strong indoor coverage supports digital payment systems and allows stores to implement tech-driven attractions (such as QR code promos or interactive displays) without worrying about network issues.\nThe partnership with Tawal is already underway, with installation at several flagship malls in Riyadh and Jeddah in progress. The cost of the project wasn't disclosed, but is understood to be part of Cenomi's regular capital expenditure budget. Industry observers note that providing free, fast internet has become a standard expectation at modern shopping centers, much like air conditioning and parking. 'Mall operators are increasingly investing in tech amenities to enhance shopper engagement,' said a regional retail consultant. 'It's about improving the overall experience, which ultimately can translate into higher sales for tenants.' Cenomi Centers' move mirrors a trend in which Gulf developers integrate technology to remain competitive and align with Saudi Arabia's digital transformation goals.",
    "impact": "Neutral",
    "reason": "This digital upgrade is unlikely to materially affect Cenomi Centers' financial position. The investment is modest relative to the company's scale and is geared toward enhancing competitiveness and customer satisfaction. It should neither significantly increase revenues nor expenses in the short term, leaving Cenomi's cash flow and credit metrics essentially unchanged."

    "title": "Saudi Fiscal Policy Shift Tests Retail Sector's Resilience",
    "body": "RIYADH, April 4, 2025 – Saudi Arabia's government is signaling a new round of fiscal measures that could temper consumer spending, posing a challenge for the Kingdom's retail and leisure industries. In a budget update released today, officials outlined proposals to raise the value-added tax (VAT) rate on discretionary goods and introduce additional fees on luxury services. The draft plan, aimed at shoring up state revenues amid ambitious public investment programs, would effectively increase the cost of many consumer purchases later this year.\nThe prospect of higher consumption taxes has retailers and mall operators on alert. Memories remain fresh of the 2020 VAT tripling from 5% to 15%, which dampened household spending power. Economists expect a smaller impact this time but still foresee a moderation in sales growth as prices creep up. 'Even a few percentage points more in VAT could nudge some families to tighten budgets,' said a Riyadh-based retail analyst. Middle-income households, already adjusting to rising living costs, may scale back non-essential purchases if the measures are implemented. Big-ticket sectors like electronics and fashion could see shoppers advance some buys before the tax hike, followed by a lull.\nSaudi Arabia's retail sector and lifestyle developments have flourished on the back of strong domestic consumption. Any pullback in spending might slow store occupancy growth or push retailers to negotiate rent relief in extreme cases, sector observers warn. However, the government's plan also includes expanded social support for lower-income citizens to offset the impact, which could blunt the overall decline in retail activity. Much will depend on the final shape of the policy when approved by the Cabinet.",
    "impact": "Bearish",
    "reason": "The anticipated VAT increase and related measures are a headwind for Saudi Arabia's retail property sector. A leading mall operator with an exclusively domestic consumer base could face softer rental income growth and pressure on occupancy rates, weakening its cash flow. That in turn would heighten credit risks, as any slowdown in revenue makes it harder to meet the company's significant financing obligations for new developments."
