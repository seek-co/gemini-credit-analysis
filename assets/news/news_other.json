    "body": "MUMBAI/LONDON – Vedanta Resources Ltd., the metals and mining conglomerate, saw its credit rating cut deeper into junk territory on Friday as the company's refinancing struggles continue to spook creditors. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Vedanta's corporate family rating to Caa3 from Caa2, and slashed the rating on its senior unsecured bonds to Ca from Caa3. The downgrade – Moody's second on Vedanta in as many quarters – reflects what the agency called 'elevated default risk' amid Vedanta's high debt maturities and strained liquidity. The outlook remains negative.\nVedanta, led by businessman Anil Agarwal, faces a wall of debt repayments totaling $6.4 billion by the end of fiscal 2025, including about $4.5 billion due within the current fiscal year. Moody's warned that the company will 'face material liquidity issues over the upcoming 24 months' and that 'default risk remains high' without swift refinancing or asset sales. The group's efforts to raise cash have yielded only partial success. Last week, Vedanta secured a $300 million short-term loan from a commodity trader, but a larger bond issuance plan has been delayed by poor market conditions. In its review, Moody's noted Vedanta's 'inability to make meaningful progress' on refinancing its looming maturities has heightened the probability of a distressed exchange or default.\nIn late 2024, Vedanta undertook a complex debt reshuffling – swapping and extending some bonds – to avoid an immediate crisis. However, Moody's viewed that transaction as a 'default avoidance' maneuver that imposed losses on creditors; essentially a distressed exchange that signaled deeper issues. The latest downgrade by Moody's effectively acknowledges that Vedanta's fundamental challenge remains unresolved: without major new funding or asset monetization, the company may be unable to meet its obligations. Vedanta's bond prices have been trading at distressed levels for months, with some longer-dated notes changing hands at 70 cents on the dollar, reflecting investors' pessimism.\nVedanta has repeatedly assured markets that it is working on a comprehensive refinancing plan. It is reportedly in talks to sell stakes in some of its operations (which span zinc, aluminum, oil & gas, and iron ore) and has approached global banks for bridge financing. In a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Vedanta said it 'disagrees with the Moody's downgrade' and called it 'overly pessimistic.' The company asserted that discussions with lenders are progressing and that it expects to meet its upcoming payment obligations. Still, credit rating agencies are unconvinced. S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings have also kept Vedanta deep in speculative grade, citing similar concerns about the company's ability to refinance.\nThe turmoil at Vedanta comes against the backdrop of a broader shake-up in India's corporate debt markets, where investors have grown wary of highly leveraged firms with large repayment needs. Agarwal's Vedanta had until recently been an emerging-markets darling able to tap international bond markets with ease. That access has narrowed considerably. The next big test will be a dollar bond maturity of around $1 billion due in August 2025; without a clear plan by mid-year, markets may assume the worst. For now, Vedanta's downgrade serves as a cautionary tale of a conglomerate stretched to its financial limits.",
